A Very Good Project created by Very Good CLI.

## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using Moneroo Flutter you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

Install via `flutter pub add`:

```sh
flutter pub add moneroo_flutter_sdk
```

---

## About ‚ùì

This package allows you to use [Moneroo](https://moneroo.io) to process payment within your Flutter app.

## Usage üöÄ

You can a have a full example [here](example/lib/main.dart). You can also your the `MonerooApi` class to implement the payment yourself without using the Moneroo widget provided by this package.

## Exception Handling üêõ

- **MonerooException**: This exception is throw when an error occured in during the API calling. You can have more infos about the related error logging the class's attribute.
- **ServiceUnavailableException**: This exception is throw when the SDK was'nt able to send your request to the server. Maybe due to network issues.

## Continuous Integration ü§ñ

Moneroo Flutter comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage is enforced using the [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].
